# LVI-ObjSemantic
A Real time LiDAR-Visual-Inertial object level semantic SLAM for Forest Environments

Our work is currently under peer review, and the dataset and code will be released after the paper is published.

Here is the GIF of our project：

Our algorithm can achieve real-time tree species identification, tree localization, and calculation of tree height and tree diameter at breast height (DBH).It can also compensate for the false detections and missed detections of YOLOv8.


The effect of point cloud coloring is also stunning, but we will share everything with everyone once the peer review is completed.
